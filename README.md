# Qwik Grid Library ⚡️

-Library in which its main objective is to have the greatest control of the behavior for the grid in qwik.

-Row and Col are used so it will be very familiar if you have already interacted with Ant Desing, Boostrap, etc.
the Grid is handled by percentage with 100% referring to the maximum.

-The Row and Col can receive properties which help us to have greater control of these.

# Qwik Grid Installation

```
npm i qwik-grid-fm
```

-Thanks for using the library if you like to make a contribution or comment you can write to us at sbarquet@forgemytech.com
